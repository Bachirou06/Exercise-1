# Exercise-1

## Problem 1 - The appetizer: Creating your own Jupyter notebook

In the “Taste of Python” lesson this week we have learned a few basic things in Python. Now you get your chance to demonstrate your skills. For this lesson, please do the following:

1. Open Jupyter lab from the [Exercise 1 landing page](https://geo-python.github.io/site/lessons/L1/exercise-1.html#part-2-cooking-up-some-python) on the course site, and create a new notebook.

2. Inside the notebook, create a variable called `my_name` and use it to store your first name and last name together in a single character string.

3. Create a variable called `ice_cream_rating` and use it to store an integer value (whole number) between 0 and 10 that reflects your general opinion about how much you enjoy eating ice cream.

4. Create another variable called `sleeping_index` and use it to store a floating point value (decimal number) between 0.0 and 1.0 that reflects your opinion about how much you enjoy sleeping. 

5. Use your Python skills to generate output on the screen similar to that below using one command to generate each line of output in a Python cell in your notebook.

```
My name is Dave Whipp and I give eating ice cream a score of 9 out of 10!
I am Dave Whipp and my sleeping enjoyment index is 0.99 out of 1.0!
```

Note that your code should replace “Dave Whipp” with the contents of your `my_name` variable, and “9” with your value stored in the variable `ice_cream_rating`, and "0.99" with your value stored in the variable `sleeping_index`.

Upload your changes to GitHub in your **own** Exercise 1 repository that you created using the GitHub Classroom link.

## Problem 2 - The main course: More practive with Python

For this problem, you can make changes to the [Jupyter notebook for Problem 2]().
